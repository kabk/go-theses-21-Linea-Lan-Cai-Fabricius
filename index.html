            <p> This paper explores transracial, intercountry adoption through a critical analysis of the gap that exists between the perception of adoption and reality. In doing so, governmental- and sociocultural aspect are inspected. Transnational
              adoption is complex, so I conducted a conversation with the lead chairman of the Danish international adoption agency, Lars Ellegaard Jørgensen. His statements and knowledge along with my own curiosity and personal story form the basis
              of this paper, combined with an investigation of the wider context of adoption and the hidden narratives by the global power structures and personal tragedies, balancing facts and fictions. </p>
            <br>
            <p>This thesis is aimed at answering the following research question: How does the perception of adoption fueled by governmental and sociocultural aspects, relate to real practical life? In order to offer a critical analysis on the state
              of adoption, this paper starts with an overview of an adoption terminology, followed by an explanation of the adoption process and its history. The main body of the thesis will explore the governmental and sociocultural aspects which
              will
              be followed by a critical conclusion that will offer some final clarity on the research findings.</p>

                “Adoption boom”.</i> These are just some of the keywords and quotes I have been collecting since the start of this paper. As such, allow me to introduce this paper: The Bliss of Adoption – An Ultimate Fairytale. You may know someone
              who has
              been adopted or you may have watched a movie portraying an orphan’s story. The perception of adoption in many people’s ears sounds like the right thing to do, a heart-warming story. So please, don’t ruin the dream. Yet, this is
              something I will most likely do with this paper. I will question the perception of adoption as Western society perceives it.</p>
            <br>
            <p> “This is a good gesture. Children who need parents and parents who need children” (Katrine W. Kjaer, Director of “Mercy Mercy”). This was Katrine’s immediate thought on adoption. You may want to adopt a child because you cannot give
              birth yourself, or you want to give the possibility of a “good life” to an orphan child. Before entering deeper into these arguments, I must first mention that I was myself an adopted child from China, raised by my beloved mother as a
              single parent. She adopted me and my non-biological sister in 1997 and 2002. But, in this paper, I will not be talking about my own story, though I will not be 100% neutral on this subject simply because of who I am. I can relate to
              this subject and will presumably be disappointed several times by my findings, but hopefully in the end my faith in the adoption system will still remain.</p>
            <br>
            <p> In the first instance, adoption of course has a noble intention. But in the second instance, however, there’s always a bigger story, often a tragedy, behind every adoption. It is exactly this second aspect that I want to focus this
              paper on. How do the official restrictions been facilitated in adoption, and how is adoption promoted? What is its impact on today’s society, and vice versa? Should we question the perception of adoption more than we are doing today?
              For this reason, this thesis formally explores the following research question: How does the perception on adoption fueled by governmental and sociocultural aspect, relate to real practical life?</p>
            <br>
            <p> This question will be examined by zooming in more closely at the formal adoption process. I will do so by looking at commonly used terminology of adoption and its history, as well as governmental aspects, both from the side of the
              receiving country as well as the country of origin. Furthermore, I will look at the sociocultural aspects of adoption, mostly by focusing on narratives and portrayal of this phenomenon in the media. Hereby, I will zoom in on four
              different media objects and cases; I will discuss two fictional film examples, Stuart Little and The Prince of Egypt, and I will zoom in on two real-life cases, the documentary Mercy Mercy, exposing a tragic adoption story, and the
              story of celebrity Madonna in adopting her Malawian son, David. By analyzing images, films, and interviews, what comes to light is that adoption is largely being glorified and romanticized in popular culture, with too little alignment
              with the practical lives of the people involved, and with the harsh reality of the adoption industry. </p>

            <h2>ADOPTION TERMINOLOGY</h2>
            <p> The term adoption refers to the act of legally taking a child to take care of them as your own, as described by Cambridge Dictionary <sup>1</sup>.Adoption can be understood as a personal act, a <u>legal process</u>, or a <u>social
                service</u>. As
              a <u>personal act</u><sup>2</sup>, it contains three triad members: the birth parents, the adoptee, and the adoption parents. The birth parents do not necessarily connect with the adoption family. In ‘The Psychology of Adoption’, David
              Brodzinsky further
              defines “…this act lifelong process rather than a single action”. As a <u>legal process</u> adoption is seen as <i>“the method provided by law to establish the legal relationship of parent and child between persons who are not so
                related by
                birth, with the same mutual right and obligations that exist between children and their birth parents.”</i><sup>3</sup> Lastly, adoption as a <u>social service</u> represents the legal link between the human perspective and the law.
              It entails addressing the steps
              from legally freeing the children to be adopted, to selecting and preparing families for adoption, preparing and placing children in adoptive families, and providing postplacement- and post-adoptive services. In this paper, I will focus
              on
              adoption as a personal act.

              <br>
            <p>Adoption is a large field with multiple types. The terminology differentiates between <i>domestic adoption, public adoptions, private domestic adoptions, transracial adoption, and intercountry adoption.</i>
              For clarification of these terms, see the table below. To narrow the field down further, this paper focuses on transracial, intercountry adoption. Transracial intercountry adoptions are the most complex types as they contain many extra
              layers including race and cultural differences, which significantly impact the pre- and post-adoption processes. As the Danish anthropologist and mother of two children from the Republic of Niger, Monica Lorenzo Pugholm,
              states:<i>“Transracial
                adoption incorporates culture meeting in so many levels”.</i><sup>4</sup> The fundamental characteristic of intercountry adoption is that the adoptee is from another country than the receiving country. It can easily be confused with
              transracial
              adoptions which are adoptions of different races or ethnicities but can happen within the same country. </p>

              <p>Adoption is a very complex and long process, involving multiple stakeholders, which can be summarized into three essential groups: the birth parents, the adoptee and the adoption parents. This adoption triad is visualized in FIG 2 as
                a
                black triangle encompassed by a red heart, which represents the adoption journey. The methods of adoption differ depending on the
                policies of the receiving country, leading to a variety of adoption scenarios. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Still, there is an ambiguity that accompanies adoption but that is not addressed in this symbol. However, do not get fooled by the adoption
                symbol, just because it contains a perfectly shaped red heart. I had the pleasure of speaking with Lars Ellegaard J ørgensen, lead chairman of the Danish International adoption agency, to gain some expert insights on this topic.
                Ellegaard and his wife, have adopted three siblings from Columbia in 1985. Ellegaard points out “Let's make it clear that adoption is a reaction to a tragedy. A tragedy that contains so much painful thought and decision making.” Up
                until this point, my research only showed adoption from the moment that the process of adopting had already begun. But from my conversation with Ellegaard I understood, that I needed to look one step before, to investigate the reasons
                for adoption. Why does adoption happen and how did it begin?</p>


              <br>
              <br>

              <h2>HISTORY OF ADOPTION</h2>

              <p>To understand the current developments of adoption and its causes, let us first clarify the historical aspects. Transracial intercountry adoption is a worldwide affair, and the world is constantly evolving. Adoption in general terms
                has been a well-known practice for centuries. It has been shaped over time by social trends and inventions to become how we know it today. Up until the early 1800s, adoption was a more political affair amongst wealthy and politically
                influential families.<sup>6</sup>Adoption has been associated with humanitarianism, upward mobility, and infertility since the Middle Ages when inheritance had to be by blood, by biology. Later on, it became a practical sphere of the
                Church with the intention of serving God and God's rules and mission. At that time, adoption took place via orphanages, where poor families would give up their child in exchange for different types of compensation.<sup>7</sup>
                Intercountry and transracial adoption first emerged as a reaction to the tragedies of the World wars and the Korean war. This form of adoption can be traced back to 1955, when couples from the US wanted to adopt “war orphans” – the
                children of foreign soldiers and native women. The children were stigmatized and abandoned due to presumptions of infidelity or illegitimacy, and so given up for adoption.<sup>8</sup> This became even more common when China opened the
                orphanages to Western countries. Important to mention, is that adoptions touched only a very small minority of children. By making this statement, it demonstrated how Western society is built up and works. When someone no longer
                “wants”
                something and is maybe in need of something else, then other people are prepared to step in and take over. Just like any other exchange, to say it very brutally.

              <p> Today, the majority of adoptions are by natal relatives and stepparents. With that being said, there are over five million Americans adoptees while Americans alone receive 50% of all intercountry adoption-children.<sup>9</sup> While
                this paper will investigate globally, it will present numbers and strategist mainly from the US and Denmark. Denmark is a convenient case study since it is the country where I got adopted to from China but also as it is part of the
                top
                ten receiving countries globally.<sup>10</sup>

            <p>Intercountry adoption is a significant component of international migration, <sup>11</sup> making it of importance both to national governments and international governments worldwide. The government is involved in how this transforms
              society and in portraying adoption through the agency and mediating organization. Agencies and mediating organizations are doing the practical work and counsel the government on how they should make the adoption laws and restrictions.
              To get an
              idea on the scale and complexity of this “market”, it’s very important to have knowledge about how power structures are collaborating across the borders. Over 45.000 children<sup>12</sup> have been part of the intercountry adoption
              since
              after World War 1 and 2. Hereby many adoptions have been legally controlled, however, intercountry adoption has several concerning issues such as child-trafficking and the role of class and race. As a way to prevent these things from
              happening, the The
              Hague Convention was initiated in 1993. Over 170 countries practiced adoption, where 30 countries practiced intercountry adoption.<sup>13</sup> In FIG 3 is a world map chart of the members of the convention and the admitted countries.
              Out of 170 countries, 85 countries are members of The Hague Convention (Figure 2) to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders in the adoption triad, especially children, to protect them against child-trafficking. A country and
              continent as
              the United States of America stands for 50% of all intercountry adoption and they signed the convention in 1994. However, they only implemented the convention in 2008. This is rather questionable. Considering the fact that they contain
              50% of the intercountry adoption, they should have been a role model for the rest of the world. Nevertheless, The Hague Convention offers only an opportunity for better cooperation between nations and the possibility of more systematic
              processes to serve children effectively. As Associate Professor Van Wichelen state: “The Convention does have an important role to play in ensuring the protection of the child and combating illegal and unethical adoptions”. The problem
              primarily rests in its implementation. As mentioned before, it went 15 years before as United states of America made the implementation. </p>
            <br>

            <p> Besides the fact that there are no uniform EU rules on adoption, there are some general principles among the counties. It is in my concern that countries cooperate more together, to make sure that the adoption system does not get
              abused, and to have the same understanding of “child welfare first”.</p>

              <p>See this family! What a big white smile on the woman's face, with her
                perfectly styled hair. She is wearing a dusty pink turtleneck. In her arms you see a toddler with black hair and a facial expression that would make most people smirk and scream out ”So cute!” She is wearing a white dress, with her
                right hand lying softly in the woman's right hand. It seems that the woman with the big smile and the little girl with the black hair are looking in the same direction. Next to them is a brown-haired man, and the man's hair seems to
                be styled just little enough so that it still seems natural. The man is looking down at the little girl with black hair with a proud smile. You can
                particularly see the smile by looking at the wrinkles around his lips, although he is not showing his teeth. He is wearing a turquoise green working-class shirt, also known as a forester's shirt. His left hand is touching either the
                woman's leg or the little girl's feet. They appear to be a very caring couple – the man with his focus on the child, while the woman is holding the child tightly and lovingly. They seem to be sitting on a grey sofa, in a white, clean
                room. Behind them you see a white wall with turquoise green curtains that match the man's shirt. How wonderful! The whole image is in a very pleasing color palette, as such we see a perfectly happy and caring couple that has adopted a

            <p>To figure out the gap between the perception of adoption and reality, it's significant to have some knowledge on the adoption process and how it's working in practice. </p>
            <br>
            <p>As said earlier, the adoption involves multiple stakeholders as in the organization, agencies, orphanage management, and The National Board of Appeal (Family Court). FIG 4 visualizes these structures of intercountry adoptions. The
              relation to the birth family might vary, for instance in the case when a child is abandoned to be found by a stranger. This was my case, as an abandoned child. So, in that case, how does the adoption process work? It has to be
              mentioned, since intercountry adoption involves so many countries, there are many different process structures, I will be focusing on the Danish adoption process as I went through it myself. The average cost of intercountry adoptions
              are around 36.000 euros, but it varies heavily by the country.<sup>15</sup> The following are requirements of the Danish law on adoption.<sup>16, 17</sup></p><br>
            <p>The Danish adoption process contains 4 phases. Before a possible adoption, the adopter is examined and approved by the Adoption Consultation in the Family Court. This is followed by an 'after adoption' phase, newly introduced in 2016.
              The average waiting time is 3 years and 9 months, from the approval to bringing the child home.<sup>18</sup> Lars Ellegard Jensen explains this long wait:<i>“It has to be difficult to make sure that the adoptee isn't abused or there are
                any misunderstandings of what it entails to adopt, not only the adoption process, but also what follows with it. We have to think about the children first. Adoption is mostly not for the adoption parents or the biological parents, but
                the child. Child welfare first! If they are not first, then it's wrong on every level.”</i> Of course, there are some significant financial aspects involved in the adoption process, this includes a high dissemination fee, depending on
              the receiving and origin country. Here Ellegaard comments: <i> “To adopt a child it's free, doesn't cost you, but you have to pay the administration costs from organization/agency, orphans management and the travel expense. There is
                clear misunderstanding here. Many perceptions in the public realm explain that you pay for a child, which is completely wrong and should be clear for everyone.”</i>

            <p>When the applicant has sent the application to the Adoption Consultant in the Family Court, the first rate of the dissemination fee will be paid (5000DKK – 684€). An Adoption Consultant in the Family Court assesses the applicants, to

              <p>§20 Married couples or cohabitants can only be approved as adopters if they have lived together for at least 2 ½ years at the time of application. Cohabitants may, however, be approved as adopters if they have lived together for at

              <p>§22 It is also a condition for being approved as an adopter that 1) the applicant's physical and mental health condition does not impair the chances that the adoption process will be in the best interests of the child, 2) the

            <p>If the general approval requirements meet up with the applicant, then the Family Court or the conciliation gives permission to continue the adoption process into Phase 2. It seems a bit absurd that restrictions are so bound to such
              specific numbers. Living together for 2 ½ years? Does it make applicants better parent for that reason? What seems important is the marriage restriction, but not the information about the adoptee itself? As well the marriage
              requirement. Both the receiving and origin countries have marriage restrictions. But, as the chart illustrates so clearly, the number of marriages each year are decreasing. A question that comes to mind is, have these restrictions been
              adjusted, after the decrease in marriages?</p>

            <p> In this paper I have aimed at presenting different perceptions of adoption, by looking at the actual history and process of adoption, in relation to different media examples, both fictional and from real life. It came to me that the
              media
              perception of adoption is strongly varying and does not align with the lived experience of the adoption triad: the birth family, the adoptee, and the adoptions family. Besides, when I dive into the literature on adoption – which is
              very
              limited, the main literature are on the adoptee’s problems. There is a lack on various perspectives from the adoption triad, especially lack on birthparents perspective.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Also, I found that power structures have a huge impact on the process and perception of adoption. For example, in the Mercy, Mercy, you see that the birth family is excepting a family relationship with the adoption family, but the
              adoption family do not wish that, and neither is the birth family getting informed about events, which led them into disappointment in the adoption system. Around the world, there are a lot of various rules and restrictions, but if a
              celebrity as Madonna can go in and make a “fast track” move, then the restrictions are not relevant anymore. As Ellegaard is saying: “It has to be difficult to make sure that the adoptee isn’t abused or there are any misunderstandings
              of
              what it entails to adopt.” I agree, but it seems there is not enough honesty nor transparency in the adoption process. I think that is one of main factors why there is a gap between rule/restriction and realities. Because every
              participant
              gets told what they want to hear. In that way it will continue to be a dream. So, please, don’t ruin the dream. The dream can’t be ruined anyway, when no one want to wake up but prefer to be in the fantasy of adoption. If it took
              place
              between the state and the origin country, it would be more feasible to avoid this desire arising from the origin countries to give the children away. But when you can get money for it, a market emerges.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I approach this paper with a critical and emotional view on the system, exposing how adoption is been used as an international migration instrument to solve the overpopulation and infertilities issues. I question and have concerns
              about
              the governmental and sociocultural approach to justify the act, by using the adoption triad as part of the global capitalistic trade. The buzzwords “child welfare first” has been used as an advertisement tool globally, yet without the
              same
              policy implementation worldwide. It’s come to my concerns that some receiving countries are abusing the intercountry adoption system by only thinking about individual fulfillment. This paper is filled with disappointment, that the
              receiving
              countries allow international business to exceed the human perspective. Child welfare should be first, right? </p>
            <br>
            <p> In my belief, the origin countries should be the ones turning to a possible recipient country to say they need parents for a child, and not the other way around. Besides, there is a need for intercontinental collaborations, and
              improvements of living standards, so that no child is left to grow up in poverty, without primary caretakers, or loving parents. There should be more up to date regulations, and greater transparency with the adoption system and the
              implementation process. Only then can the title of my thesis - The Bliss of Adoption – An Ultimate Fairytale – possibly move from being sarcastic, to being genuinely sincere. </p>
            <br>


            <p> My head is spinning and full of thoughts, so I will finish up and go to sleep. </p>
