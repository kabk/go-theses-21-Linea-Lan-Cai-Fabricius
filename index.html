        <p> “Don’t ruin the Dream”, “The hero trap”, “The fake diversity”, “White savory”, “Personal branding”, “Twist and turn”, “Perception”, “Bliss”, “Delusional”, “Deprivation”, ”Gap”, “Celebrity adoption”, “Governmental regulation”, “Adoption
          boom”. These are just some of the keywords and quotes I have been collecting since the start of this paper. As such, allow me to introduce this paper: The Bliss of Adoption – An Ultimate Fairytale. You may know someone who has been adopted
          or you may have watched a movie portraying an orphan’s story. The perception of adoption in many people’s ears sounds like the right thing to do, a heart-warming story. So please, don’t ruin the dream. Yet, this is something I will most
          likely do with this paper. I will question the perception of adoption as Western society perceives it. </p>
        <br>
        <p>“This is a good gesture. Children who need parents and parents who need children” (Katrine W. Kjaer, Director of “Mercy Mercy”). This was Katrine’s immediate thought on adoption. You may want to adopt a child because you cannot give birth
          yourself, or you want to give the possibility of a “good life” to an orphan child. Before entering deeper into these arguments, I must first mention that I was myself an adopted child from China, raised by my beloved mother as a single
          parent. She adopted me and my non-biological sister in 1997 and 2002. But, in this paper, I will not be talking about my own story, though I will not be 100% neutral on this subject simply because of who I am. I can relate to this subject
          and will presumably be disappointed several times by my findings, but hopefully in the end my faith in the adoption system will still remain.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the first instance, adoption of course has a noble intention. But in the second instance, however, there’s always a bigger story, often a tragedy, behind every adoption. It is exactly this second aspect that I want to focus this paper
          on. How do the official restrictions been facilitated in adoption, and how is adoption promoted? What is its impact on today’s society, and vice versa? Should we question the perception of adoption more than we are doing today? For this
          reason, this thesis formally explores the following research question: How does the perception on adoption fueled by governmental and sociocultural aspect, relate to real practical life?</p>
        <br>
        <p>This question will be examined by zooming in more closely at the formal adoption process. I will do so by looking at commonly used terminology of adoption and its history, as well as governmental aspects, both from the side of the
          receiving country as well as the country of origin. Furthermore, I will look at the sociocultural aspects of adoption, mostly by focusing on narratives and portrayal of this phenomenon in the media. Hereby, I will zoom in on four different
          media objects and -cases; I will discuss two fictional film examples, Stuart Little and The Prince of Egypt, and I will zoom in on two real-life cases, the documentary Mercy Mercy, exposing a tragic adoption story, and the story of
          celebrity Madonna in adopting her Malawian son, David. By analyzing images, films, and interviews, what comes to light is that adoption is largely being glorified and romanticized in popular culture, with too little alignment with the
          practical lives of the people involved, and with the harsh reality of the adoption industry. </p>

        <p> The term adoption refers to the act of legally taking a child to take care of them as your own, as described by Cambridge Dictionary <sup>1</sup>.Adoption can be understood as a personal act, a legal process, or a social service. As a
          personal act , it contains three triad members: the birth parents, the adoptee, and the adoption parents. The birth parents do not necessarily connect with the adoption family. In ‘The Psychology of Adoption’, David Brodzinsky further
          defines “…this act lifelong process rather than a single action”. As a legal process adoption is seen as “the method provided by law to establish the legal relationship of parent and child between persons who are not so related by birth,
          with the same mutual right and obligations that exist between children and their birth parents.”Lastly, adoption as a social service represents the legal link between the human perspective and the law. It entails addressing the steps from
          legally freeing the children to be adopted, to selecting and preparing families for adoption, preparing and placing children in adoptive families, and providing postplacement- and post-adoptive services. In this paper, I will focus on
          adoption as a personal act. <br> Adoption is a large field with multiple types. The terminology differentiates between domestic adoption, public adoptions, private domestic adoptions, transracial adoption, and intercountry adoption. For
          clarification of these terms, see the table below. To narrow the field down further, this paper focuses on transracial, intercountry adoption. Transracial intercountry adoptions are the most complex types as they contain many extra layers
          including race and cultural differences, which significantly impact the pre- and post-adoption processes. As the Danish anthropologist and mother of two children from the Republic of Niger, Monica Lorenzo Pugholm, states: “Transracial
          adoption incorporates culture meeting in so many levels”. The fundamental characteristic of intercountry adoption is that the adoptee is from another country than the receiving country. It can easily be confused with transracial adoptions
          which are adoptions of different races or ethnicities but can happen within the same country. </p>

        <p>Intercountry adoption is a significant component of international migration , making it of importance both to national governments and international governments worldwide. The government is involved in how this transforms society and in
          portraying adoption through the agency and mediating organization. Agencies and mediating organizations are doing the practical work and counsel the government on how they should make the adoption laws and restrictions. To get an idea on
          the scale and complexity of this “market”, it’s very important to have knowledge about how power structures are collaborating across the borders. Over 45.000 children have been part of the intercountry adoption since after World War 1 and
          2. Hereby many adoptions have been legally controlled, however, intercountry adoption has several concerning issues such as child-trafficking and the role of class and race. As a way to prevent these things from happening, the The Hague
          Convention was initiated in 1993. Over 170 countries practiced adoption, where 30 countries practiced intercountry adoption . In figure 5 is a world map chart of the members of the convention and the admitted countries. Out of 170
          countries, 85 countries are members of The Hague Convention (Figure 2) to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders in the adoption triad, especially children, to protect them against child-trafficking. A country and continent as the
          United States of America stands for 50% of all intercountry adoption and they signed the convention in 1994. However, they only implemented the convention in 2008. This is rather questionable. Considering the fact that they contain 50% of
          the intercountry adoption, they should have been a role model for the rest of the world. Nevertheless, The Hague Convention offers only an opportunity for better cooperation between nations and the possibility of more systematic processes
          to serve children effectively. As Associate Professor Van Wichelen state: “The Convention does have an important role to play in ensuring the protection of the child and combating illegal and unethical adoptions”. The problem primarily
          rests in its implementation. As mentioned before, it went 15 years before as United states of America made the implementation. </p>

        <br>

        <p> In this paper I have aimed at presenting different perceptions of adoption, by looking at the actual history and process of adoption, in relation to different media examples, both fictional and from real life. It came to me that the media
          perception of adoption is strongly varying and does not align with the lived experience of the adoption triad: the birth family, the adoptee, and the adoptions family. Besides, when I dive into the literature on adoption – which is very
          limited, the main literature are on the adoptee’s problems. There is a lack on various perspectives from the adoption triad, especially lack on birthparents perspective.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Also, I found that power structures have a huge impact on the process and perception of adoption. For example, in the Mercy, Mercy, you see that the birth family is excepting a family relationship with the adoption family, but the
          adoption family do not wish that, and neither is the birth family getting informed about events, which led them into disappointment in the adoption system. Around the world, there are a lot of various rules and restrictions, but if a
          celebrity as Madonna can go in and make a “fast track” move, then the restrictions are not relevant anymore. As Ellegaard is saying: “It has to be difficult to make sure that the adoptee isn’t abused or there are any misunderstandings of
          what it entails to adopt.” I agree, but it seems there is not enough honesty nor transparency in the adoption process. I think that is one of main factors why there is a gap between rule/restriction and realities. Because every participant
          gets told what they want to hear. In that way it will continue to be a dream. So, please, don’t ruin the dream. The dream can’t be ruined anyway, when no one want to wake up but prefer to be in the fantasy of adoption. If it took place
          between the state and the origin country, it would be more feasible to avoid this desire arising from the origin countries to give the children away. But when you can get money for it, a market emerges.</p>
        <br>
        <p> I approach this paper with a critical and emotional view on the system, exposing how adoption is been used as an international migration instrument to solve the overpopulation and infertilities issues. I question and have concerns about
          the governmental and sociocultural approach to justify the act, by using the adoption triad as part of the global capitalistic trade. The buzzwords “child welfare first” has been used as an advertisement tool globally, yet without the same
          policy implementation worldwide. It’s come to my concerns that some receiving countries are abusing the intercountry adoption system by only thinking about individual fulfillment. This paper is filled with disappointment, that the receiving
          countries allow international business to exceed the human perspective. Child welfare should be first, right? </p>
        <br>
        <p> In my belief, the origin countries should be the ones turning to a possible recipient country to say they need parents for a child, and not the other way around. Besides, there is a need for intercontinental collaborations, and
          improvements of living standards, so that no child is left to grow up in poverty, without primary caretakers, or loving parents. There should be more up to date regulations, and greater transparency with the adoption system and the
          implementation process. Only then can the title of my thesis - The Bliss of Adoption – An Ultimate Fairytale – possibly move from being sarcastic, to being genuinely sincere. </p>
        <br>


        <p> My head is spinning and full of thoughts, so I will finish up and go to sleep. </p>
