            <p> This paper explores transracial, intercountry adoption through a critical analysis of the gap that exists between the perception of adoption and reality. In doing so, governmental- and sociocultural aspect are inspected. Transnational
              adoption is complex, so I conducted a conversation with the lead chairman of the Danish international adoption agency, Lars Ellegaard Jørgensen. His statements and knowledge along with my own curiosity and personal story form the basis
              of
              this paper, combined with an investigation of the wider context of adoption and the hidden narratives by the global power structures and personal tragedies, balancing facts and fictions. </p>
            <br>
            <p>This thesis is aimed at answering the following research question: How does the perception of adoption fueled by governmental and sociocultural aspects, relate to real practical life? In order to offer a critical analysis on the state
              of
              adoption, this paper starts with an overview of an adoption terminology, followed by an explanation of the adoption process and its history. The main body of the thesis will explore the governmental and sociocultural aspects which will
              be
              followed by a critical conclusion that will offer some final clarity on the research findings.</p>

            <p> The term adoption refers to the act of legally taking a child to take care of them as your own, as described by Cambridge Dictionary <sup>1</sup>.Adoption can be understood as a personal act, a legal process, or a social service. As a
              personal act , it contains three triad members: the birth parents, the adoptee, and the adoption parents. The birth parents do not necessarily connect with the adoption family. In ‘The Psychology of Adoption’, David Brodzinsky further
              defines “…this act lifelong process rather than a single action”. As a legal process adoption is seen as “the method provided by law to establish the legal relationship of parent and child between persons who are not so related by birth,
              with the same mutual right and obligations that exist between children and their birth parents.”Lastly, adoption as a social service represents the legal link between the human perspective and the law. It entails addressing the steps from
              legally freeing the children to be adopted, to selecting and preparing families for adoption, preparing and placing children in adoptive families, and providing postplacement- and post-adoptive services. In this paper, I will focus on
              adoption as a personal act. <br> Adoption is a large field with multiple types. The terminology differentiates between domestic adoption, public adoptions, private domestic adoptions, transracial adoption, and intercountry adoption. For
              clarification of these terms, see the table below. To narrow the field down further, this paper focuses on transracial, intercountry adoption. Transracial intercountry adoptions are the most complex types as they contain many extra layers
              including race and cultural differences, which significantly impact the pre- and post-adoption processes. As the Danish anthropologist and mother of two children from the Republic of Niger, Monica Lorenzo Pugholm, states: “Transracial
              adoption incorporates culture meeting in so many levels”. The fundamental characteristic of intercountry adoption is that the adoptee is from another country than the receiving country. It can easily be confused with transracial adoptions
              which are adoptions of different races or ethnicities but can happen within the same country. </p>

            <p>Intercountry adoption is a significant component of international migration , making it of importance both to national governments and international governments worldwide. The government is involved in how this transforms society and
              in
              portraying adoption through the agency and mediating organization. Agencies and mediating organizations are doing the practical work and counsel the government on how they should make the adoption laws and restrictions. To get an idea
              on
              the scale and complexity of this “market”, it’s very important to have knowledge about how power structures are collaborating across the borders. Over 45.000 children have been part of the intercountry adoption since after World War 1
              and
              2. Hereby many adoptions have been legally controlled, however, intercountry adoption has several concerning issues such as child-trafficking and the role of class and race. As a way to prevent these things from happening, the The Hague
              Convention was initiated in 1993. Over 170 countries practiced adoption, where 30 countries practiced intercountry adoption . In figure 5 is a world map chart of the members of the convention and the admitted countries. Out of 170
              countries, 85 countries are members of The Hague Convention (Figure 2) to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders in the adoption triad, especially children, to protect them against child-trafficking. A country and continent as the
              United States of America stands for 50% of all intercountry adoption and they signed the convention in 1994. However, they only implemented the convention in 2008. This is rather questionable. Considering the fact that they contain 50%
              of
              the intercountry adoption, they should have been a role model for the rest of the world. Nevertheless, The Hague Convention offers only an opportunity for better cooperation between nations and the possibility of more systematic
              processes
              to serve children effectively. As Associate Professor Van Wichelen state: “The Convention does have an important role to play in ensuring the protection of the child and combating illegal and unethical adoptions”. The problem primarily
              rests in its implementation. As mentioned before, it went 15 years before as United states of America made the implementation. </p>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <br>

            <p> In this paper I have aimed at presenting different perceptions of adoption, by looking at the actual history and process of adoption, in relation to different media examples, both fictional and from real life. It came to me that the
              media
              perception of adoption is strongly varying and does not align with the lived experience of the adoption triad: the birth family, the adoptee, and the adoptions family. Besides, when I dive into the literature on adoption – which is very
              limited, the main literature are on the adoptee’s problems. There is a lack on various perspectives from the adoption triad, especially lack on birthparents perspective.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Also, I found that power structures have a huge impact on the process and perception of adoption. For example, in the Mercy, Mercy, you see that the birth family is excepting a family relationship with the adoption family, but the
              adoption family do not wish that, and neither is the birth family getting informed about events, which led them into disappointment in the adoption system. Around the world, there are a lot of various rules and restrictions, but if a
              celebrity as Madonna can go in and make a “fast track” move, then the restrictions are not relevant anymore. As Ellegaard is saying: “It has to be difficult to make sure that the adoptee isn’t abused or there are any misunderstandings
              of
              what it entails to adopt.” I agree, but it seems there is not enough honesty nor transparency in the adoption process. I think that is one of main factors why there is a gap between rule/restriction and realities. Because every
              participant
              gets told what they want to hear. In that way it will continue to be a dream. So, please, don’t ruin the dream. The dream can’t be ruined anyway, when no one want to wake up but prefer to be in the fantasy of adoption. If it took place
              between the state and the origin country, it would be more feasible to avoid this desire arising from the origin countries to give the children away. But when you can get money for it, a market emerges.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I approach this paper with a critical and emotional view on the system, exposing how adoption is been used as an international migration instrument to solve the overpopulation and infertilities issues. I question and have concerns
              about
              the governmental and sociocultural approach to justify the act, by using the adoption triad as part of the global capitalistic trade. The buzzwords “child welfare first” has been used as an advertisement tool globally, yet without the
              same
              policy implementation worldwide. It’s come to my concerns that some receiving countries are abusing the intercountry adoption system by only thinking about individual fulfillment. This paper is filled with disappointment, that the
              receiving
              countries allow international business to exceed the human perspective. Child welfare should be first, right? </p>
            <br>
            <p> In my belief, the origin countries should be the ones turning to a possible recipient country to say they need parents for a child, and not the other way around. Besides, there is a need for intercontinental collaborations, and
              improvements of living standards, so that no child is left to grow up in poverty, without primary caretakers, or loving parents. There should be more up to date regulations, and greater transparency with the adoption system and the
              implementation process. Only then can the title of my thesis - The Bliss of Adoption – An Ultimate Fairytale – possibly move from being sarcastic, to being genuinely sincere. </p>
            <br>


            <p> My head is spinning and full of thoughts, so I will finish up and go to sleep. </p>
